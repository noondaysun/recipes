### Choc-chip biscuits without baking soda

**Ingredients**


*1 stick unsalted butter, (browned if desired)
*1/2 cup granulated sugar
*1/4 cup brown sugar
*2 tsp pure vanilla extract
*1 egg
*1/2 tsp kosher salt
*1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
*1 cup chocolate chips (I prefer at least 60% dark chocolate)
*coarse salt for sprinkling if desired


**Method**

>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F/180&deg;C.
>In a large bowl with a hand mixer, or the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and the sugars until fluffy. Add the vanilla and the egg, and beat until combined.
>Add the salt and then the flour in small amounts, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips. Scoop cookies onto cookie sheets. I use a large scoop that is just barely less than 1/4 cup of dough. Do not overcrowd them. Sprinkle coarse salt on top of each, if desired. (you should. it brings the cookies up a level)
>Bake at 350&deg;F/180&deg;C for 8-12 minutes, until the edges are just set. Remove from the oven and let cool on the cookie sheets (cookies will continue cooking and finish setting.)
