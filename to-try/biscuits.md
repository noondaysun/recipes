### Choc-chip biscuits without baking soda

**Ingredients**

* 1 stick unsalted butter, (browned if desired)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup chocolate chips (I prefer at least 60% dark chocolate)
* coarse salt for sprinkling if desired


**Method**

><p>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F/180&deg;C.</p>
><p>In a large bowl with a hand mixer, or the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and the sugars until fluffy. Add the vanilla and the egg, and beat until combined.</p>
><p>Add the salt and then the flour in small amounts, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips. Scoop cookies onto cookie sheets. I use alarge scoop that is just barely less than 1/4 cup of dough. Do not overcrowd them. Sprinkle coarse salt on top of each, if desired. (you should. it brings the cookies up a level)</p>
><p>Bake at 350&deg;F/180&deg;C for 8-12 minutes, until the edges are just set. 
Remove from the oven and let cool on the cookie sheets (cookies will continue cooking and finish setting.)</p>


### Gingerbread biscuits

**Ingredients**

* 225g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra to grease
* 340g soft brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 340g plain flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* &frac12; tsp salt
* 1&frac12; tsp grated nutmeg
* 1&frac12; tsp ground cloves
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 3 tsp ground ginger
* 75g crystallised ginger or dried apricots, finely chopped
* 225g icing sugar (optional)
* Hundreds and thousands (optional)


**Method**

><p>Put the softened butter in a bowl and beat briefly to break it up. Add the sugar and beat again until there are no lumps and the mixture is well combined – you can use a wooden spoon for this if you’re feeling strong, or the beating tool on a food mixer, which will be quicker and easier.</p>
><p>Break the egg into a cup or jug and beat with a fork to mix the yolk and white. Very gradually beat the egg into the butter and sugar mixture, a little at a time so it doesn’t curdle. If it does start to look grainy, don’t worry – just add a little flour to bring it back together.</p>
><p>Put the flour, baking powder, salt and spices in a separate bowl and whisk to mix and help break up any lumps. Now stir them into the butter and sugar until the mixture comes together into a dough. Stir the finely chopped crystallised ginger or dried apricots into the dough as well.</p>
><p>Spread a large rectangle of clingfilm on a work surface and put the gingerbread dough on top. Cover it with another large rectangle of clingfilm, then gently roll out with a rolling pin until the dough is about 3mm thick. Transfer to a baking sheet or chopping board, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>
><p>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and lightly grease two baking sheets. Remove the top layer of clingfilm, cut out the biscuits using cookie cutters of whatever shape you like, then arrange on the baking sheets, leaving a couple of centimetres between each one, so they have room to spread out while they bake. Roll out the dough between two sheets of clingfilm, cut out any shapes you like, then bake.</p>
><p>Bake for 10 minutes. Make sure you have a skewer or cocktail stick ready and, as soon as you take the biscuits out of the oven, poke holes big enough to thread a ribbon through in the top – it’s important to do this when the biscuits are still warm, because if you wait until they cool, they will break.</p>
><p>Very gently transfer the biscuits to a wire rack (they will still be soft, but don’t worry – they’ll crisp up as they cool) and leave to cool completely before you begin to ice them. If you put the icing on when they’re too warm, it will just run off.</p>
><p>If you want to ice the biscuits, sift the icing sugar into a wide bowl to get rid of any lumps. Stir in just enough boiling water to make a smooth paste, then dip one face of each biscuit in the icing. Sprinkle with hundreds and thousands, if using, then put back on the rack to set.</p>
><p>Alternatively, decorate the biscuits with writing icing or melt some chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of boiling water (or in the microwave) and drizzle over the cooled biscuits. Poke through the holes again if they become clogged with icing, then thread through a ribbon or a piece of string, to hang up the biscuits with.</p>

### Nigella Lawson’s sweet and salty peanut biscuits

**Ingredients**

* light muscovado sugar 75g, plus more for dipping later
* unsalted butter 100g
* vegetable shortening such as Trex 50g
* egg 1 large
* vanilla extract 1 tsp
* self-raising flour 175g
* salted peanuts 125g
* baking sheets 2, lined


**Method**

><p>Preheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. In a large bowl, mix together the sugar, butter, shortening, egg and vanilla. Just beat it together, no ceremony, to combine well. You may find this easiest to do with an electric mixer. Stir in the flour and then the peanuts – and that’s your dough done. Now, drop the dough in rounded teaspoons about 5cm apart onto the prepared baking sheets.</p>
><p>Oil the bottom of a glass, or brush with melted butter, and dip it into some more light muscovado sugar and then press gently on the biscuits to flatten them.</p>
><p>Bake for 8-10 minutes, by which time they should be cooked through (though remember that biscuits always continue to cook for a while out of the oven), then remove to a wire rack to cool.</p>

### Justin Gellatly’s butter fingers

**Ingredients**

* plain flour 220g
* fine sea salt a pinch
* cornflour 70g
* vanilla pod 1
* unsalted butter 250g, softened
* icing sugar 60g
* dark chocolate 100g, 70% cocoa solids, broken into pieces


**Method**

><p>Preheat the oven to 160C/gas 3 and line two large baking trays with baking paper. Sift the flour, salt and cornflour into a large bowl and mix together well.</p>
><p>Split the vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds. Put into a food processor with the butter and icing sugar, add the flour mix and whizz until it becomes a smooth paste.</p>
><p>Put the mixture into a piping bag with a 1cm-wide star nozzle and pipe about 40 lines of fingers about 6cm long onto the prepared baking trays. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>
><p>Leave on the trays for 5 minutes, then put on a rack to cool.</p>
><p>Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. When the fingers are cool, dip into your melted chocolate and place on a rack until the chocolate sets.</p>

### Chocolate chip, rose and marzipan cookies

**Ingredients**

* butter 125g
* light muscovado sugar 75g
* caster sugar 75g
* egg 1
* plain flour 250g
* bicarbonate of soda &frac12; tsp
* crystallised rose petals 20g
* marzipan 200g
* dark chocolate 150g
* vanilla extract


**Method**

><p>You will also need a baking sheet, lined with baking parchment</p>
><p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Cream the butter and sugars together until they are light and the colour of milky coffee. You can do it by hand, but the lightest results are to be had from using an electric mixer fitted with a flat beater. Break the egg into a small bowl, mix the white and yolk together with a fork, then combine with the butter and sugar.</p>
><p>Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and fold into the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Finely chop the rose petals and break or cut the marzipan into small pieces and add both to the mixture. Chop the chocolate into small nuggets then fold into the cookie dough with a couple of drops of vanilla extract.</p>
><p>Roll the mixture into spheres approximately the size of a golf ball, setting them out on the baking sheet, leaving room for them to spread. (I cook eight at a time on a 30 x 30cm baking sheet.) Bake for 10-12 minutes, until each cookie is pale and lightly risen. Remove the tray from the oven and leave to settle for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Continue with the next batch. The cookies will keep in a biscuit tin for several days.</p>
