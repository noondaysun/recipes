### Potato Cakes

**Ingredients**

* 2 medium potatoes (approx 500g)
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 100g queso anejo, Romano cheese, salted ricotta or pecorino, grated
* 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
* Salt and black pepper
* Oil for frying

**Method**

><p>Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender. Once cool enough, peel and then either crush the potatoes with your hands or a fork, or pass through a potato ricer. Add the egg, cheese and parsley to the potato, mix, then taste and season as required.</p>
><p>Pour enough oil to come 1.25cm up the sides of a heavy-based frying pan â€“ the smaller the pan, the less oil you will need), and heat. When the oil is hot, add tablespoonfuls of the mixture to the pan, flattening each portion slightly with the back of a fork. Fry, turning from time to time, until the potato cakes are a deep golden colour on both sides.</p>
><p>Lift the cakes from the oil on to a plate lined with kitchen towel to blot, but then serve immediately</p>
