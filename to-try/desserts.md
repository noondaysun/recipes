### 

**Ingredients**


* 4 tbsp dulce de leche or canned caramel (we used Carnation)
* &frac12; tsp sea salt, plus extra to serve
* 85g each milk and dark chocolate, broken into squares
* 1-2 long, thin, plain grissini (Optional)
* 2 tbsp demerara sugar
* 100ml double cream, at room temperature
* 50ml milk

**Method**

>Mix the caramel with the salt, divide between 2 small glasses and chill.

>Melt the chocolates together in a glass bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Snap the grissini into short lengths, then dip each end into the chocolate to coat a little. Sit on a wire rack for the chocolate to drip and set a little, then dip the chocolate ends into the sugar to coat. Sit in an airtight container lined with baking parchment and chill to set until ready to serve.

>Stir the double cream and milk into the remaining melted chocolate until smooth, then scrape into a jug. Slowly pour on top of the caramel, around the edges first. Chill the pots for at least 2 hrs, or up to 24 hrs.

>To serve, scatter a little more sea salt on top of each pot, then add one or two sugar-tipped grissini.
